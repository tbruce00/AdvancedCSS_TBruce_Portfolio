# Homework_AdvancedCSS_Portfolio

## Wev Developer Portfolio Page

For this project we were tasked with creating a portfolio resembling that of a web developer to present to potential employers.

To acheive this task we were required to include: 

    * A section that explains who we are.
    * A section that displays our work.
    * A section with contact information.


## Aspects of Portfolio Page

We were required to code our HTML and CSS in a way that utilized CSS flexbox, CSS variables, and Media Queries.

In doing this the page is organized in a way that is interesting and easy to navigate by including links that when clicked scroll to the corresponding sections.

The deployed application displays a webpage that is responsive to different screen sizes and devices.
